The Coding Out Loud series created a keyboard with the first letter of all the wordle words. The code in my repo uses a renewed dataset of the wordle words and follows the code in the series. However, my code reches beyond that and calculates the total number of letters in all positions in the wordle words (not only the first letter). I go through the same process and color code the letters on the keyboard based on the frequency they are used. This data can be utilized by wordle players to choose the first word they put into their daily wordle to maximize their chances of choosing a letter in the word. The code also slightly customizes the keyboard that is constructed, but since the package itself does not allow that much customization, the difference between the default keyboard and my customized one is not dramatic.
